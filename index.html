            A child asked his father, "How were peopel born?" S his father said,
            "Adam and Eve made babies, then their babies became adults and made
            babies, and son on." The child then went to his mother, asked her
            the same question and she told him, "We were monkeys then we evolved
            to become like we are now." The child ran back to his father and
            said, "You lied to me!" His father replied, "No, your mom was
            talking about her side of the family."
